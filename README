    BPM::Engine - Business process execution engine

VERSION
    0.001

SYNOPSIS
      use BPM::Engine;
  
      my $callback = sub {
            my($runner, $entity, $event, $node, $instance) = @_;
            ...
            };
  
      my $engine = BPM::Engine->new(
          log_dispatch_conf => 'log.conf',
          connect_info      => { dsn => $dsn, user => $user, password => $password },
          callback          => $callback
          );
  
      my $package = $engine->create_package('/path/to/model.xpdl');

      my @workflows = $engine->list_process_definitions->all;
  
      my $instance = $engine->create_process_instance(
          $process, 'Client xyz', { param1 => 'value1' }
          );
  
      $engine->start_process_instance($instance);

DESCRIPTION
    BPM::Engine is an embeddable workflow process engine with persistence.
    It handles saving and loading XPDL packages in a database, and running
    workflow processes.

WARNING
    Currently this is alpha code and should be considered HIGHLY
    EXPERIMENTAL. This module is still in heavy flux, and will change. I
    welcome any opinions, ideas for extensions, etc. However, tests are
    incomplete, documentation is nonexistent, and interfaces are subject to
    change. Don't use this in production.

    Please review the test files and source code to see how it works.
