    BPM::Engine - Business Process Execution Engine

VERSION
    0.001

SYNOPSIS
    Create a new bpm engine

      use BPM::Engine;

      my $callback = sub {
            my($runner, $entity, $event, $node, $instance) = @_;
            ...
            };

      my $engine = BPM::Engine->new(
          log_dispatch_conf => 'log.conf',
          connect_info      => { dsn => $dsn, user => $user, password => $password },
          callback          => $callback
          );

    Save an XPDL file with workflow process definitions, and retrieve the
    process definitions

      my $package = $engine->create_package('/path/to/model.xpdl');

      my @processes = $engine->get_process_definitions->all;

    Create and run a process instance

      my $instance = $engine->create_process_instance(
          $process, 'Client xyz', { param1 => 'value1' }
          );

      $engine->start_process_instance($instance);

DESCRIPTION
    BPM::Engine is an embeddable workflow process engine with persistence.
    It handles saving and loading XPDL packages in a database, and running
    workflow processes.

INTERFACE
  Constructors
   BPM::Engine->new(%options)
    Creates a new bpm engine.

        $engine = BPM::Engine->new(
          connect_info => {
            dsn      => $dsn,
            user     => $user,
            password => $pass,
            %dbi_attributes,
            %extra_attributes,
            });

    Possible options are:

    "schema => $schema // BpmEngineStore"
        BPM::Engine::Store connected schema object. If not provided, one
        will be created using the "connect_info" option.

        Either "schema" or "connect_info" is required on object
        construction.

    "connect_info => $dsn // ConnectInfo"
        DBIx::Class::Schema connection arguments that get passed to the
        "connect()" call to BPM::Engine::Store, as specified by the
        "ConnectInfo" type in BPM::Engine::Types::Internal.

        Usually a single hashref with dsn/user/password and attributes.

        This attribute is only used to build the "schema" attribute if not
        provided already.

    "logger => $logger // BpmEngineLogger"
        A logger object that implements the BPM::Engine::Role::LoggerAPI
        role, defaults to a BPM::Engine::Logger instance constructed with
        "log_dispatch_conf".

    "log_dispatch_conf => $file | $hashref"
        Optional constructor argument for BPM::Engine::Logger to build the
        default "logger", if a logger was not provided.

    "callback => \&cb"
        Optional callback *&cb* which is called on all process instance
        events. This option is passed to any "BPM::Engine::ProcessRunner"
        constructor.

    "runner_traits => [qw/TraitA TraitB/] // []"
        Optional traits to be supplied to all "BPM::Engine::ProcessRunner"
        objects used.

   BPM::Engine->new_with_config(%options)
        $engine = BPM::Engine->new_with_config(
          configfile => "/etc/bpmengine/engine.conf"
          );

    Provided by the base role MooseX::SimpleConfig. Acts just like regular
    "new()", but also accepts an argument "configfile" to specify the
    configfile from which to load other attributes.

    "configfile => $file // $ENV{HOME}/bpmengine/engine.conf"
        A file that, when passed to "new_with_config", is parsed using
        Config::Any to support any of a variety of different config formats,
        detected by the file extension. See Config::Any for more details
        about supported formats.

    Explicit arguments to "new_with_config" will override anything loaded
    from the configfile.

   BPM::Engine->new_with_traits(%options)
    Just like "new()", but also accepts a "traits" argument with a list of
    trait names to apply to the engine object.

        $engine = BPM::Engine->new_with_traits(
            traits => [qw/Foo Bar/],
            schema => $schema
            );

    Options, in addition to those to "new()":

    "traits => \@traitnames // []"
        Traits live under the "BPM::Engine::Trait" namespace by default,
        prefix full class names with a "+".

   BPM::Engine->with_traits(@traits)->new(%options)
    You can use the "with_traits" class method to use traits in combination
    with a configuration file. Example:

        $engine = BPM::Engine->with_traits(qw/Foo Bar/)->new_with_config(
          configfile => '/home/user/bpmengine.conf'
          );

   create_package
        $package = $engine->create_package($file);

   delete_package

        $process = $engine->get_process_definition

  PROCESS INSTANCE METHODS

        $rs = $engine->get_process_instances();

   get_process_instance
        $process_instance = $engine->get_process_instance($pi_id);

  ACTIVITY INSTANCE METHODS

   get_activity_instance
   change_activity_instance_state
   activity_instance_attribute
  LOGGING METHODS
    log, debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency

  INTERNAL METHODS
   runner
    Returns a new BPM::Engine::ProcessRunner instance with the
    "runner_traits" and "callback" attribute applied for the specified
    process instance. Internal method, used by "start_process_instance()"
    and "change_activity_instance_state()" to advance a process instance.

DIAGNOSTICS
  Exception Handling
    When "BPM::Engine" encounters an API error, it throws a
    "BPM::Engine::Exception" object. You can catch and process these
    exceptions, see BPM::Engine::Exception for more information.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    BPM::Engine may optionally be configured with a configuration file when
    constructed using the "new_with_config" method. See etc/engine.yaml for
    an example.

BUGS
    Plenty. Along with error conditions not being handled gracefully etc.

    They will be fixed in due course as I start using this more seriously,
    however in the meantime, patches are welcome :)
